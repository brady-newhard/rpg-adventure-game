RPG Adventure Game

This is a simple turn-based fantasy RPG written in Python. It was built as a group project using object-oriented programming concepts like classes, methods, and attributes.

How it works:
- You play as a hero with a weapon.
- You battle a monster in a turn-by-turn fight.
- Each side attacks until one runs out of health.
- If you win, you collect loot like gold, weapons, and potions.

To run:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. In your terminal, navigate to the project folder.
3. Run: python3 main.py

Files include:
- main.py: runs the game
- characters.py: the player character
- monster.py: enemy logic
- weapon.py + attack.py: weapon and attack setup
- potion.py, loot.py, inventory.py: items and inventory
- quest.py + gameEngine.py: quest setup and game loop
- battle.py: handles the actual fight logic

Built by Brady Newhard, Isaac Jean Baptiste, Matt Mendez Zugenbuehler & Howard Ueckert during General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp.
